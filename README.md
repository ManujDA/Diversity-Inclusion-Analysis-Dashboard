# Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard developed to support the Human Resources team at a leading telecom company in addressing gender balance challenges at the executive management level. The dashboard provides actionable insights through data visualisation and analysis, helping to identify barriers to diversity and inclusion (D&I) and offering recommendations for improvement.

## How to Use the Dashboard
Download the Power BI (.pbix) file from the repository and open it using Power BI Desktop. The dashboard is structured into three key sections:
- **Diversity and Inclusion Overview**:
  This page provides a summary of key metrics with filters at the top to refine the data.
- **Performance and Age Group Analysis**:
  This page delves into performance ratings and employee age demographics. 
- **Demographics and Department Diversity**:
  This page focuses on workforce composition and department-specific diversity metrics. 

## Stakeholder Requirements
Human Resources teams at the telecom company have been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive level but have struggled to make significant progress. To address this, they approached us with the following objectives:
- **Analyse workforce diversity**: Understand gender ratios, hiring trends, promotion rates, and retention patterns.
- **Identify barriers to progress**: Pinpoint structural or cultural challenges preventing female advancement.
- **Measure the impact of initiatives**: Track the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion efforts and ensure accountability.
- **Provide actionable recommendations**: Use data insights to inform decisions and propose tangible steps toward achieving gender balance.

This dashboard addresses these objectives by enabling the HR leadership to make informed, data-driven decisions and focus on actionable solutions.

- **Demographics and Department Diversity**:
  - Gender distribution by department, highlighting male-dominated and female-dominated departments.
  - Nationality diversity with a focus on gender representation.
  - Summary of overall workforce metrics, including total employees, turnover, and promotions.

## Key Metrics
The workforce currently consists of 500 employees, with a gender ratio of 60% male (300) and 40% female (200). At the executive level, representation is skewed with 75% male and 25% female employees. Key career progression metrics reveal:

- **Promotion Rate**: 10% for males, 6% for females, with an overall rate of 8%.
- **New Hires Distribution**: 55% male, 45% female.
- **Performance Ratings**: Average rating of 2.7/4.0 for males and 2.8/4.0 for females.
- **Turnover Rates**: 15% for females in executive roles compared to 8% for males.

## Insights
- Recruitment channels such as traditional job boards heavily favour male candidates (70%), while diversity-focused platforms achieve a balanced gender split. Employee referrals remain male-biased (65%).
- Female employees experience slower promotion velocity (3.2 years vs. 2.8 years for males) despite achieving similar performance ratings. Representation diminishes at higher management levels.
- Retention issues are most pronounced among mid-management females, with work-life balance cited as a primary reason for turnover in 65% of exit interviews.

## Root Causes
- Structural barriers in recruitment, including reliance on male-dominated channels and limited mentorship opportunities for women.
- Inflexible senior-level working arrangements and subjective performance evaluation processes.
- Lack of transparency and standardisation in promotion practices, coupled with biases in high-visibility project allocations.

## Recommendations
  - Implement blind CV screening and mandate diverse interview panels.
  - Partner with women-focused professional networks to expand the candidate pool.
  - Standardise performance evaluation criteria and introduce bias training.
  - Launch formal mentorship and sponsorship programmes for female employees.
  - Offer flexible working options for senior roles and improve parental leave policies.
  - Establish clear career progression frameworks and create succession planning for diverse leadership pipelines.
  - Conduct regular culture surveys to address workplace challenges.
  - Build partnerships with STEM initiatives to strengthen the pipeline of female talent.
  - Create leadership academies for underrepresented groups.
  - Publish annual diversity reports and lead industry forums to establish best practices.

## Implementation and Future Enhancements
The dashboard supports monthly KPI reviews, quarterly updates for stakeholders and annual assessments to refine strategies. Future enhancements include:

- Real-time data integration with HR systems.
- Predictive analytics to assess turnover risks.
- Machine learning algorithms to detect biases in recruitment and evaluation processes.
- A mobile-friendly version of the dashboard for broader accessibility.
